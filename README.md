The military fiefdom system combined with the primogeniture inheritance system is the optimal solution for the ancient grassroots rule after the invention of the stirrup, the real unity of the military and the people, and the foundation of a strong army.

The strongest combat system is the citizen-fubing conscription system, but in the period of equipped cavalry after the stirrups, cavalry was the core of the battlefield, and ordinary farmers no longer had the economic basis to prepare their own armed forces to participate in the war.

It is inevitable in the military system to let some of the population out of the recruitment sequence and become the supporters of the military population, and some of them become full-time soldiers. From this, there are two military systems, the standing army system and the military recruitment system with small and medium landlords and nobles as the main recruits. Yi system.

Why the benefice system saves money, because the benefit chain from the support personnel to the military personnel is shortened.

Under the financial system of a certain place: farmers produce 100,000 tons of grain, 20,000 tons are given to non-military landlords, and 30,000 tons are given to the court. 10,000 tons, 10,000 tons of 20,000 tons of grain are used to pay the salaries of civil servants and eunuchs who do not perform military service, and other court expenses. In fact, this is already very ideal. 20,000 tons of grain and 10,000 to the army is 50% of the military financial ratio. , In most cases, we can’t reach it. We don’t care how much of the 10,000 tons of food is actually left on the heads of individual soldiers after being exploited layer by layer by the governor. Anyway, it means that the wealth given to the army is the wealth of the general 10% of the wealth, which is the best result under the excellent administrative efficiency and extremely militarized system.

It is not that the ancient rulers were unaware of the problem of the erosion of the country's military capabilities by a large number of off-duty non-military personnel, but their reaction was: they all blamed the capitalists. Except for businessmen and intellectuals who wandered around, no one was hiding from military service. Who would have thought that Feila, the later Legalist dynasty, would be like this.

What about under the fiefdom system? The answer is 50%. Farmers' income is all paid to soldiers, and 50% of the country's wealth is supported by the army. There is no non-military landlord, civil servant, eunuch, emperor, general, etc. A series of levels of exploitation, the real income of grassroots soldiers or even Ten times as much as in a certain place, if the serfs were given rent reductions, and the tax burden was 30%, the army's expenditures were still very considerable.

Whose thought is practiced by the military fiefdom system is the thought of Confucius, who we mentioned earlier. Confucianism is synonymous with Feila in our traditional understanding. However, in real history, the real Feila The most important are those waste dynasties who put on the dog head of Confucianism and sell the sheepskin of Legalism.

Even if you make up your mind to carry out land reform and eliminate the non-military landlords who are purely parasitic classes, your management costs at each level will be there and cannot be suppressed. At the beginning of your business, you can let everyone in the military and government at all levels eat chaff Drinking water, when is it time to start a business? The governor of the governor, the governor of the state, and the governor of the state, invent an inspection team every ten or twenty years, one layer after another, one bed after another, and the illegal corruption costs become legal supervision expenses, and the money is not saved. The bureaucratic class is getting bigger and bigger, the corruption is getting worse, the army is getting more and more short of money, there are no landlords and gentry, and the countryside still doesn't want to let go. If they want to manage, they need village cadres. Which of these guys eats less than the landlords? Landlords can’t pick up houses and raise cows casually. They can pay farmers a 50% agricultural tax at the beginning of the 21st century. Take care of yourself, if you can't continue playing someday, you can only overthrow it and start over.

It is not that there are no landlords and officials under the military fiefdom system, but under the military fiefdom system, landlords, officials and soldiers have dual identities. , Generals are generals outside, prime ministers inside, soldiers are cavalry outside, landlords and village cadres inside, corruption and corruption under the fiefdom system will further strengthen the strength of the army, and the money embezzled by the prime minister will become private soldiers, The money embezzled by the village chief will be turned into armor. The more serious the corruption, the stronger the country’s military power. Awesome, right?

The military fiefdom system cannot realize what Wang Anshi said about the state using the people without paying taxes, but it can certainly realize the people not adding taxes and using the military.

The fundamental reason why the country is rich ≠ the army is strong is that most of the country’s expenditures divert the wealth originally paid to the army under a series of beautiful slogans. The better ones can be turned into wonder buildings, and the almost ones go directly into various buildings. Pockets of various non-military related personnel for their various extravagant expenses.

Under normal circumstances, considering only the financial situation, the actual military expenditure of a country with a military fiefdom system is ten times that of the Song and Ming regimes. The military power of a city-controlled country should be completely equal to that of a local government with a population of 100 million. This has indeed been proved in history. Assuming that all the commanders and soldiers are as incompetent as Song Dynasty, in terms of military strength alone, Da Song Neng fought back and forth with Xixia, and met a population of tens of millions. Even if the general is mentally handicapped, he can still crush Song Ming. Without him, the inequality between Zhao, Song and Zhu Ming: 100 million < 10 million, your national strength with a population of 100 million is weak Well, if someone else has a population of 10 million and plenty of manpower, wouldn't that mean they will hit you with a drop of ten?

There is a clever idea of how farmers pay taxes and pay money. Farmers sell grain at a low price to raise money and are exploited again. Soldiers who buy grain at a high price are also exploited. The super empire with a population of 200 million and 100,000 soldiers is about to go bankrupt. This is not very normal? Farmers have paid taxes to the point of bankruptcy, but soldiers on the front line are still starving. This is not because the soldiers under the fiefdom system are strong, but because the standing army system is too pitiful, creating too long a chain of interests, and too much garbage that is not agricultural or non-farming. The garbage population of the soldiers, the leading class of the entire country is eroding the combat effectiveness of the army, the national administrative system is established on the basis of eroding the army's finances, the country is strong, the soldiers are weak, and the soldiers are weak, the country is destroyed.

For financial institutions, will the additional taxes levied during the war be suspended after the end of the war? Absolutely impossible, they will lay off the army simply and neatly, and then find a way to spend the remaining money. The military expenditure is paid to the army by the administrative agency, so it can be cut naturally, and the administrative funds are allocated to themselves. Since ancient times, only There is no reason to go up and down. This money will become an unshakable fixed expenditure, and a penny less will cause chaos in the world. When the army has no money in the next war, new taxes will naturally be added, and so on, until there is nothing to collect. , Bankrupt the kingdom, which is the root cause of why most modern countries absolutely do not allow civil servants to govern.

In fact, the competition of military strength in ancient countries is to compare who has more landlords and who has stronger landlords.

The superstructure is not important. There is no difference in combat effectiveness between a democracy and a tyrant country. As long as his basic military service unit is changed from an individual adult male in the past to a landlord who owns a manor and a certain number of serfs, the country’s war potential can be fully realized. come out.

The key to measuring whether a society has entered the feudal era is whether there are serfs in the country.

A country without serfdom was institutionally primitive.

It is inevitable that primitive countries cannot defeat advanced countries, because without strong landlords, there will be no strong cavalry, and thus there will be no strong army.

Of course, not all civilizations with a strong landlord class have a strong army. I’m talking about Little Japan, because this unlucky kid didn’t have a horse. Otherwise, he would have had the opportunity to participate in the representative of the Wadi Dynasty. According to the logic, Wude is compared to the horse's mouth, not the population. No matter how abundant the warrior's martial arts is, it is only at the level of street fighting. The quality of the population is not as good as the quantity of the horse's mouth.

Most civilizations successfully entered the feudal era in the 13th and 15th centuries.

Moreover, the most powerful feature of the fiefdom system is not the military support model of the feudal lords themselves.

What's more, under the military fiefdom system, there will be a large number of second sons who have received complete military education but have no territorial inheritance.

This is the best volunteer soldier. It doesn’t cost a dime. As long as you draw a circle and promise them serfs and fiefdoms, their parents will empty out their property to buy armored horses and send their precious little sons to fight for you on the battlefield.

Every ten years or so, there will be such a group of energetic young men, the idle rich second generation gearing up to start their own careers.

Moreover, the beneficiary system greatly limits the country's financial capacity, and the higher the country's financial capacity, the greater the country's room for corruption. The beneficiary system allows the country to continue to be in the The state of lack of money greatly limits the ruler's desire for extravagance, and the impoverished second son, as a supervisor, can also limit the extravagance of the entire upper class of society, which leads to the long-term decline of the society under the military fiefdom system. Maintain the social style of hard work and simplicity, joy in fighting and martial arts.

All of the above are based on the strict eldest son inheritance system, because once the land is allowed to be equally divided and inherited, the manors that bear the burden of cavalry will be quickly fragmented and small-scale farmers will be available. Inheritance is the root cause of the inability to completely eliminate the small peasant economy.



In summary, both Legalism and Confucianism are militaristic political ideologies that serve military needs.

The difference is that Legalism emphasizes universal military service. Military service is the prerequisite for civil rights. If all people serve in the military, then all people are equal.

Against the backdrop of the rise of infantry in the Warring States Period, Qin, which was able to produce a large number of infantry, was naturally the strongest. However, in the Middle Ages, the rise of cavalry changed. Appeared, the infantry was able to do it again, you see the Confucian feudal system was swept into the garbage dump of history again.

Confucianism emphasizes the obligation of some people to serve in the military. According to the social program that those who serve in the military have political rights, non-military personnel are naturally inferior, and the inferior are paid by soldiers.

For a company, suppose there is a company commander, three platoon leaders, 9 squad leaders, and 100 big soldiers. The monthly salary of the big soldiers is 3,000, the squad leader is 5,000, the platoon leader is 8,000, and the company leader is 10,000. Then naturally, the big soldiers are divided into 30 households. The serfs and corresponding land support, 50 squad leaders, 80 platoon leaders, and 100 company leaders.

These serfs only pay taxes to their lords. The serfs of the soldiers are not under the control of the squad leader. The squad leader only manages his own serfs and soldiers, and the company commander manages his own serfs and platoon leaders. In fact, there are more than 3,000 serfs under a company commander. They belong to the outright feudal lord However, due to the feudal relationship, the wealth he occupies is nothing more than one hundred households directly under his own.

So why do soldiers listen to the squad leader, and the squad leader listens to the platoon leader? The answer is military decrees. The company commander is not responsible for paying the soldiers, but as long as there are decrees, the company commander can order the platoon leader and punish soldiers who do not obey the order. Confucianism calls it ritual system, and Europe calls it feudal obligation.

The dispute between Confucianism and Legalism is actually a spiral, which requires a lot of wealth to support armed chariots and cavalry. During the period when armed chariots and cavalry prevailed, Confucianism and the sequential social system represented by it were the optimal solution to the military system, while the era of the rise of infantry emphasized equality for everyone. Under the current universal military service system, massive cannon fodder is the kingly way. Whoever turns ahead in the era of technological change will be the wave of the times.
